                    <div class="intro-text">
                        <p>Sports have been a part of my life since before I can remember. I started playing soccer at four years old, started practicing karate by five, and more recently, fell in love with basketball during high school. I still compete at a high level, such as with the Bond University Soccer Club, where I led the team as Most Valuable Player to winning the league title in 2025.</p>
                        <p>My other biggest passion area is storytelling. I was an actor through my younger years and started writing a few years later. I chose to pursue my passion for writing seriously by studying a Bachelor of Creative Arts at Bond University, where I am set to graduate in April of 2026.</p>
                        <p>I had been aware of sports journalism for many years before I came to Bond University, but I had always thought it existed in a separate world to mine. This idea ended abruptly when I was generously offered the opportunity to complete an internship with FIBA Oceania in the final months of 2025. I was able to hone my skills under the wing of Communications Lead Stacey French, and it was during this time that I realised just how well sports journalism blended two of my biggest passion areas.</p>
                        <p>I am now pursuing an opportunity to work in sports journalism, where I can bring my passion for storytelling and sports to an audience. I will deliver both written and video content using the skills I have developed with FIBA and at Bond University. My specialisation in Creative Writing, alongside my majors in Communications and Digital Media, have provided me with industry-ready writing skills and proficiency in website development and content creation using the Adobe Creative Suite. With FIBA, I have gained experience in time-management and working to meet strict deadlines, adaptability to work under pressure or changing conditions, and interview skills with people from many different backgrounds across Oceania.</p>
                        <p>Below is a collection of my work during my time with FIBA Oceania.</p>
